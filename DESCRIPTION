Title: Bayesian Clustering using Truncated Stick-Breaking priors
Version: 1.0
Author: Denis Valle <drvalle@ufl.edu>
Maintainer: Denis Valle <drvalle@ufl.edu>
Description: An implementation of three different types of Bayesian clustering methods: 
	mixture models, stochastic block models, and species archetype models. The 
	number of clusters is automatically estimated from the data using a Bayesian 
	nonparametric approach based on truncated Stick-Breaking priors.
