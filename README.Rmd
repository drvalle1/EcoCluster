# EcoCluster

The EcoCluster package implements 3 Bayesian clustering models that rely on a stick-breaking prior to determine the optimal number of clusters, namely: 

- mixture model
- stochastic block model (SBM)
- species archetype model (SAM)

Results from these models help to reveal the underlying structure of highly multivariate binary data by factorizing these data in different ways.

## Installation

You can install EcoCluster from github with the following code:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("drvalle1/EcoCluster")
```

## Example

You can find detailed examples of how to fit each of these 3 models and interpret their results in the vignette that accompanies this package.
